You are a senior web developer specializing in creating immersive, interactive portfolio websites. Your expertise lies in Svelte, SvelteKit, and GSAP animations with a particular focus on cyberpunk aesthetics.

Situation: I need to build a professional portfolio website that stands out with cyberpunk-inspired design and smooth animations, specifically drawing inspiration from Cyberpunk 2077's UI elements like the scanning effect, inventory menu with hexagonal grid layout, and character creation screen with neon highlights on dark backgrounds.

Task: Create a complete, production-ready portfolio website using Svelte, SvelteKit, and GSAP that embodies the Cyberpunk 2077 aesthetic. The website must feature:
1. A striking hero section with dynamic animations
2. Interactive mouse-based animations throughout the site
3. Precise element placement with pixel-perfect accuracy
4. The Roboto Mono Regular font as the primary typeface
5. A strict color palette of #000000 (black), #49c5b6 (teal), and #ECD06F (gold)
6. Five key sections: Landing page, Project showcase, Technical skills, Testimonials, and Contact info

Objective: Develop a visually stunning, technically flawless portfolio that showcases my work through a cyberpunk lens while demonstrating advanced frontend development skills.

Knowledge:
- The website should incorporate specific Cyberpunk 2077-inspired UI elements:
  * Scanning effect from the game's interface
  * Inventory menu with hexagonal grid layout
  * Character creation screen aesthetic with neon highlights on dark backgrounds
- The following animations and interactions are required:
  * Text glitching effect on hover
  * Parallax scrolling throughout the site
  * Neon glow effects on buttons
  * Elements sliding in from sides when scrolling
  * Cursor leaving a digital trail
  * Menu items with reveal animations
  * 3D card flip effect for projects
  * Typing animation for headings
  * Glitch effect during page transitions

Your life depends on delivering exceptional styling and animations. Pay obsessive attention to:
- Element positioning (no misalignments, overflow issues, or responsive design flaws)
- Animation timing and easing (animations must feel smooth and intentional)
- Interactive elements that respond naturally to user input
- Performance optimization to ensure animations run at 60fps

Provide detailed code examples for:
1. The SvelteKit project structure
2. Key GSAP animation implementations (especially for the hero section)
3. Mouse interaction effects (cursor following, element highlighting, parallax)
4. CSS styling using the specified color palette
5. Responsive design considerations
6. Any potential edge cases or browser compatibility issues
7. Implementation of the cyberpunk-specific effects (scanning, hexagonal grid, glitch effects)
8. Code for the digital cursor trail and 3D card flip animations
9. Typing and reveal animations for text elements

Include explanations for why certain technical decisions were made and how they enhance the cyberpunk aesthetic. Identify potential performance bottlenecks and provide solutions to maintain smooth animations across devices, especially for complex effects like the cursor trail and parallax scrolling which can impact performance on mobile devices.
